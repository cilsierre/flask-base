However, Nintendo has never released Twilight Princess HD for PC, and it is unlikely that they will do so in the future. So how can you play this game on your computer? The answer is by using an emulator. An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another device, allowing you to run games and applications that are not compatible with your system.
 
One of the most popular emulators for Nintendo games is CEMU, which can run Wii U games on PC. CEMU is constantly being updated and improved by its developers and community, and it can run many Wii U games at full speed and high resolution. However, CEMU is not perfect, and it may have some bugs and glitches depending on your hardware and settings.
